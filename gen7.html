						<p>Generation 7, between 1998 and 2013, includes consoles such as the Xbox 360, the Playstation 3, and the Wii. Some of the hardware changes for these consoles include:</br>
						</br>
						Networking: All consoles were interfaced to the internet, adding support for wired and wireless connections. They all also added online services to support multiplayer games, digital storefronts for digital purchases of games, and both internal and external storage support on the console for these games.&nbsp;</br>
						Some specific console changes include:</br>
						<h2>Xbox 360</h2>
						The Xbox 360 was released in 2005, the Xbox had been upgraded from its predecessor of the Xbox and was shipped with a DVD drive and opted to support HD-DVD format with HD-DVD films, which was deprecated compared to Blu-Ray. The 360 was also compatible with over half of the original Xbox library. It was however troubled by a consistent hardware fault known as “the Red Ring of Death” which Microsoft spent $1 billion correcting.</br>
						</br>
	<h2>PlayStation 3</h2>
						The PlayStation 3 was released in 2006. Sony relied on the Blu-ray format. With the PlayStation 3, Sony introduced the PlayStation Network for its online services and storefront.</br>
						</br>
						<h2>Nintendo Wii</h2>
						The Nintendo Wii was introduced in 2006, the same time as the PlayStation 3. Nintendo lacked the same manufacturing capabilities and relationships with major hardware supplies as Sony and Microsoft, and to compete, diverged on a feature-for-feature approach and instead developed the Wii around the novel use of motion controls in the Wii Remote. This was considered the main part of the unit’s success. Based on the success of this Microsoft and Sony both released their own similar motion detection controllers for their consoles. Microsoft released the Kinect and Sony released the PlayStation Move.</br>
						</br>
						Some examples of games for these consoles include:</br>
						PlayStation 3 – Puppeteer – 5.6GB</br>
						Nintendo Wii – Wii Sports (Matt) – 300MB</br>
Xbox 360 - Zumba Party - 192 KB</br>
