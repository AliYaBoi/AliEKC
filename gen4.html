					<p>Generation 4, being between 1987 and 2004, includes consoles such as the TurboGrafx-16, the Neo Genesis, and the Super NES. Some hardware changes include:</p>
					<p>&nbsp;The companies creating the consoles back then (Hudson Soft, Sega, SNK Corp, and Nintendo), created their games on CD-ROMS to offer more space than game cartridges and could allow full motion video and other detailed audio works to be used in games. Console manufacturers would then create add-ons to their consoles that could read the CD-ROMs and play them, including NEC’s TurboGrafx-CD add-on. Costs were high, nearing the same price as the console itself. </p>
				  <p>The 4th generation also overlapped into the 5th generation with Sony's PlayStation.</p>
					<h2>TurboGrafx-16:</h2>
				  <p>With the Turbografx-16, it was the first fourth generation console even though it still had an 8-bit CPU. However, with the 16-bit graphics processor, it was given capabilities comparable to other fourth generation consoles. This gave NEC's marketing an advancement over the NES as a "16-bit system".</p>
				  <h2>Sega Mega Drive:</h2>
					<p>In 1988, Sega released the Mega Drive, also known as the Genesis in North America, with a library of over 900 games. While fairing poorly against competitors in Japan, it saw commercial success in other parts of the world, particularly in North America. It was later changed to Genesis in North America because David Rosen disliked the name "Mega Drive" and wanted to represent "a new beginning" for Sega. Later in 1991, the American release for the NES triggered a battle for market share, known as a "console war". Before they were discontinued, 30.75 million first-party Genesis units were sold worldwide.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
					<h2>Neo Geo:</h2>
					<p>Released in 1990, which attempted to bridge the gap between arcade and home console systems, the Neo Geo was released. This system was marketed as the first 24-bit system, which was the most powerful system released from that time. This console and arcade system managed to sell a total of 980,000 units including sales of the Neo Geo CD, which came at a later date.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
				  <h2>Super NES:</h2>
					<p>&nbsp;Released in 1990, the Super NES, which was commonly shortened to Super Nintendo, is a 16-bit home video game console, which introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time. This console received largely positive reviews and was a global success, becoming the best selling console of the 16-bit era.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
