					<p>Handheld gaming consoles have existed for years as a way to provide entertainment for those on the go, with a history lasting since 1979.<br></p>
					
					<img src="images/content/microvision.png" width = "30%" height = "30%">
					<h2>1970s</h2>
					<p>1979 - The Milton Bradley Company creates the Microvision, the first handheld console to use interchangeable cartridges.</p>
					
					<img src="images/content/gameboy.png" width = "30%" height = "30%">
					<h2>1980s</h2>
					<p>1981 - Entex Industries releases the Select-A Game with 2 attached controllers, making it the first multiplayer handheld.<br>
					1984 - The Palmtex Portable Videogame System is released, the first non-monochrome handheld.<br>

					<img src="images/content/gamegear.png" width = "30%" height = "30%">
					<h2>1990s</h2>
					<p>1990 - The Sega Game Gear is released, featuring a colour screen with a backlight. While sales lagged behind the Game Boy, it outsold many competitors.<br>
					1995 - Sega releases the Nomad, which could play the entire library of the Sega Genesis. A lack of exclusives combined with a poor launch window led to it being considered a commercial failure.<br>
					1998 - The Game Boy Color launches, a hardware revision of the original Game Boy with a colour screen.</p>
					
					<img src="images/content/nintendods.png" width = "30%" height = "30%">

					<h2>2010s</h2>
					<p>2011 - Nintendo releases the 3DS, with stereoscopic 3D projection without the need for 3D glasses. Sony releases the PlayStation Vita as a successor to the PSP. It is considered a commercial failure but has gained a cult following.<br>
					2016 - The original open-source Arduboy is released, based on the Arduino hardware platform.<br>
					2017 - The Nintendo Switch is released. It is the first mainstream "hybrid console", capable of being played as a handheld or as a home console.</p>
					
					<img src="images/content/analoguepocket.png" width = "30%" height = "30%">
					<h2>2020s</h2>
					<p>2021 - The Analogue Pocket is released, capable of playing cartridges for older handhelds such as Game Boy Advance, Game Gear and Neo Geo Pocket.<br>
					2022 - The Playdate is released, featuring a crank as a control method. Valve releases the Steam Deck, the first mainstream handheld PC.</p>
