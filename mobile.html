<p>As the ownership of mobile phone has skyrocketed to the point of almost every home having at least one its no surprise the gaming community has latched onto the platform to create more avenues for gaming.</p>

		
<h2>Creation of the iPhone and IOS App Store</h2>
					<p>In June 29th, 2007 Apple release the iPhone which was seen as revolutionary at the time, the device would eventually lead to an entire genre of games being created. Before the app store came out on July 10th, 2008 only Jailbroken iPhones could install games. When the IOS app store released it allowed anyone to create programs for their phone to run, this technology would be used to host thousands of games over time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
					
                    <h2>Angry Birds</h2>
                    <p>In December of 2009 Finnish game studio Rovio released a game to the IOS app store called Angry Birds(would eventually be renamed to Angry Birds: Classic before being renamed again to Red's First Flight), the game featured an incredibly simple gameplay loop that led to it becoming wildly popular on mobile devices, having 12 million copies been sold on IOS alone by october 2010. The massive success prompted Rovio to port the game to many other devices, such as Android, Blackberry and Windows phones.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
					<h2>Candy Crush Saga and Freemium Games</h2>
					<p>In April of 2012 Swedish game studio King adapted a browser game they created for use with IOS(Android and Windows phone ports would come a few months later) phones. Candy Crush would go on to become the most played mobile game ever, with over 500 million downloads as of March 2023</p>
				  <p>Candy Crush is seen as one of the first games to use the "freemium" pricing model, allowing you to play the game for free but allowing you to pay for benefits in game(such as more lives or no ads). While controversial for their pay-to-win nature, freemium games have become one of the most succesful business models for mobile developers, with Candy Crush making almost a million a day at its peak.</p>
				  <h2>Pokémon Go</h2>
					<p>On July 6 2016, Niantic developed and published the game Pokémon Go on both IOS and Android phones. Pokémon Go is an augmented reality experience where the user must physically travel in order to encounter Pokémon and Gyms, which were typically located in real locations of interest.</p>
					<h5>Controversy</h5>
					<p>As Pokémon Go's gameplay loop was based on physically travelling to real locations originally there were concerns about players causing disruptions or issues for the general public. Additionally, since Pokémon Gyms were located in places of interest a few were located in dangerous locations, with one being in the Korean Demilitarised Zone until it was removed.</p>
					
					<h2>Epic Games Vs Apple and Google</h2>
					<h5>Beginning</h5>
					<p>On April 2, 2018 Fortnite: Battle Royale released on IOS(Augsust 9th for android) as a port to the wildly popular console/PC game. Epic Games would repeatedly advocate for a lower revenue share for mobile storefronts, going as far as making Android users sideload the official Epic Games storefront to avoid the 30% revenue share on the Google Play Store. In a similar protest Epic Games updated Fortnite on August 13, 2020 allowing users to bypass the IOS store payment system, this lead to apple removing Fortnite from the Apple storefront.</p>
				  <h5>Epic Games v. Apple</h5>
				  <p>After the removal of Fortnite on storefronts, Epic Games filed a lawsuit against Apple, Epic specifically targetted Apple forbidding alternative in-app payment methods to bypass the storefront cut.  </p>
					<p>The trial ran from May 3th to May 24th 2021 with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers deciding in favour of Apple on 9 out of 10 counts, with Apple only being found breaking California Unfair Competition Law.</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 40px"><i>"Thus, and in summary, the Court does not find that Apple is an antitrust monopolist in the
					submarket for mobile gaming transactions. However, it does find that Apple’s conduct in
					enforcing anti-steering restrictions is anticompetitive"</i><a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2021/09/10/epic-v-apple.pdf"> -Epic Games Vs. Apple (Page 180, Paragraph 6) </a></p>
					<p>Judge Rogers ruled that Epic is required to pay Apple $3.6 million and stated that Epic violated its contractual terms as a developer wiht Apple.</p>
