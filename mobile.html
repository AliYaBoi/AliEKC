<p>As the ownership of mobile phone has skyrocketed to the point of almost every home having at least one its no surprise the gaming community has latched onto the platform to create more avenues for gaming.</p>

		
<h2>Creation of the iPhone and IOS App Store</h2>
					<p>In June 29th, 2007 Apple release the iPhone which was seen as revolutionary at the time, the device would eventually lead to an entire genre of games being created. Before the app store came out on July 10th, 2008 only Jailbroken iPhones could install games. When the IOS app store released it allowed anyone to create programs for their phone to run, this technology would be used to host thousands of games over time.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
					
                    <h2>Angry Birds</h2>
                    <p>In December of 2009 Finnish game studio Rovio released a game to the IOS app store called Angry Birds(would eventually be renamed to Angry Birds: Classic before being renamed again to Red's First Flight), the game featured an incredibly simple gameplay loop that led to it becoming wildly popular on mobile devices, having 12 million copies been sold on IOS alone by october 2010. The massive success prompted Rovio to port the game to many other devices, such as Android, Blackberry and Windows phones.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
